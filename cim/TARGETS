Report for 27/28/29 3/2020
1. Code Study for CIMDraw. 
2. Searched for UX Template layout for improving CIMDraw Editor. https://github.com/givanz/VvvebJs/tree/master/demo fits best as both VvvebJs  CIMDraw uses bootsraap & JQuery as core.
3. Merged CIMDraw in VvvebJs Template Layput as UX of CIMDRaw is poor.
4. Improved following UI/UX components
    - Header Layout with Menu Support, edit, select, pan for Drawing Canvas, Undo/Redo Icons(Core code for undo/redo is not done), preview, fullscreen support.
    - Added left drawer for CIMDraw elements(breaker, disconnector, etc).
